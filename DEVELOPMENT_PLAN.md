# MiniYouApp Development Plan

## 🎯 Current Status: iOS-First Development

**Web support has been temporarily removed** to focus on building a solid iOS app first. This eliminates web bundling issues and allows for faster development.

## 📱 Phase 1: iOS Development (Current)

### ✅ Completed
- ✅ Expo TypeScript project setup
- ✅ Redux store with all slices
- ✅ Navigation system
- ✅ Welcome screen with bear branding
- ✅ Color system and design constants
- ✅ TypeScript types and interfaces
- ✅ OpenAI service integration
- ✅ Image processing service
- ✅ Platform utilities (iOS/Android only)
- ✅ Clean iOS development environment

### 🔄 In Progress
- 🔄 Photo upload functionality
- 🔄 Style selection screen
- 🔄 AI generation screen
- 🔄 Result and export screen

### 📋 Next Steps for iOS
1. **Complete PhotoUploadScreen**
   - Camera integration
   - Gallery picker
   - Image preview
   - Background removal option

2. **Build StyleSelectionScreen**
   - Style grid layout
   - Style previews
   - Premium style indicators

3. **Implement GenerationScreen**
   - Progress indicators
   - AI integration
   - Error handling

4. **Create ResultScreen**
   - Image display
   - Export options
   - Share functionality

## 🌐 Phase 2: Web Support (Future - After iOS MVP)

### Web Development Strategy
1. **Complete iOS MVP** - Get the core app working perfectly on iOS
2. **Test all features** - Ensure everything works smoothly
3. **Add web support incrementally** - One component at a time
4. **Platform-specific optimizations** - Tailor for web experience

### Web-Specific Considerations
- **File Upload**: Browser file picker instead of camera
- **Download**: Browser download API instead of native sharing
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt layouts for desktop/tablet
- **Performance**: Optimize for web loading

## 🚀 Current Development Commands

### iOS Development
```bash
# Start iOS development (recommended)
npx expo start --ios

# Or use the general start command
npm start
# Then press 'i' for iOS
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test on physical device
# Scan QR code with Expo Go app

# Test on simulator
# Press 'i' in the terminal
```

## 🎯 Immediate Goals

1. **Get iOS app working perfectly** ✅
2. **Complete all core screens**
3. **Test AI integration**
4. **Polish UI/UX**
5. **Add web support later**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you encounter issues:
1. **Clear cache**: `npx expo start --clear`
2. **Reset Metro**: `npx expo start --reset-cache`
3. **Reinstall dependencies**: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Web Issues (resolved for now):
- ✅ Web bundling issues eliminated
- ✅ Focus on iOS for faster development
- ✅ Web support will be added after iOS MVP
